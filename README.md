# Getting Started with Basic React Application Template

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App]

To Start the projet  : 
:: yarn install 
:: yarn start



## Highlights

In the project directory, I've created the best basic template which is ready to use. I've created the basic folder structure along with routes, layouts, views, @core, components, utils and API.

###  `API Documentation`

For the API part, I've used Apollo Client.[https://www.apollographql.com/docs/react/]. 
This is one of the best Clients to use which supports features like caching out of the box. I've implemented it in a way that you don't need to maintain the state when the API returns the data. This will be a big performance boost for your application.

### `@core should have core components like Navbar, header etc.`

### Any updates/feedbacks are highly welcome.
